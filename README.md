# studentManagementSystem
ðŸ‘€: BSCS 1st semester programming project This is a console-based clone of my university's student portal implemented in C language using basic principles of programming. This project serves three users, i.e., students,teachers,and administrators.
Students can view their grades and profiles,file a grade change report,and view assignment deadlines
Teachers can upload or change marks, upload assignment deadlines,and answer requests 
Admins can approve new accounts,finalise GPA, and upload fees
